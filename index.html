        <h1>My trip to</h1>
        <h1>Rio de Janiero</h1>
        <p>Five days was the perfect amount of time and Rio was the perfect place. Everything that happened to us worked out in a way that made us wonder how we could be that lucky. If something was closed we found something better, if something lasted all day it was undoubtedly worth it. Our second spring equinox of the year passed in Rio—an appropriate end to the summer and beginning to a few more months of change, growth, warmth, and discovery.</p>

            <h2>The three best activities in Rio.</h2>
            <p>At Copacabana beach the ocean waves crashed into us—even standing where our knees were barely submerged—-with a force great enough to sweep us off our feet. I ate dinner at the top of Sugar Loag mountain, far above the clouds, and watched their masses roll over and drift through the scattered hills. We swayed to the Bossa Nova at a music fair and layed on a bed of itchy grass in the square. </p>
